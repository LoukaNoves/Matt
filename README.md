# Matt Language Support for Visual Studio Code

This extension provides syntax highlighting and language support for the Matt programming language in Visual Studio Code.

## Features

- Syntax highlighting for Matt language files (`.matt`).
- Basic language configuration including comments and brackets.

## Installation

1. Download the latest `.vsix` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/your-username/matt-language/releases) page.
2. Open Visual Studio Code.
3. Go to the Extensions view by clicking the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
4. Click on the three-dot menu in the top-right corner of the Extensions view.
5. Select "Install from VSIX..." and choose the downloaded `.vsix` file.

## Usage

1. Open a file with the `.matt` extension in Visual Studio Code.
2. The syntax highlighting and language features should be automatically applied.

## Syntax of the Matt Language

The Matt language supports basic programming constructs such as variable assignments, arithmetic operations, conditional statements, and printing. Below are some examples of the syntax:

### Variable Assignment

```matt
x = 10;
y = 20;
```

### Arithmetic Operations

```matt
z = x + y;
a = x - y;
b = x * y;
c = x / y;
```

### Conditional Statements

```matt
if (x > y) {
    print("x is greater than y");
} else {
    print("x is not greater than y");
}
```

### Printing

```matt
print(x);
print("Hello, World!");
```

### Defining and Importing Libraries

```matt
library MyLibrary {
    x = 42;
    print("Library loaded");
}

import MyLibrary;
print(MyLibrary.x);
```

These examples demonstrate the basic syntax and usage of the Matt language. You can create `.matt` files and use these constructs to write programs in the Matt language.

## Development

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/matt-language.git
   cd matt-language
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```

4. Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.

### Making Changes

- Make sure the language configuration settings in `language-configuration.json` are accurate.
- Modify the 

matt.tmLanguage.json

 file to update the syntax highlighting rules.
- Reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes.

### Publishing

1. Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with the necessary permissions.
2. Login to `vsce` with your PAT:
